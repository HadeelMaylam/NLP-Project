# Document Retriever from Web-Scraped Dataset

## Project Overview

This week's project focuses on building a document retrieval system using a web-scraped dataset. The system should allow users to query and retrieve relevant documents from a chosen dataset.

### Objectives

- Understand the basics of document retrieval systems.
- Gain hands-on experience with web scraping and dataset preparation.
- Implement a system to process, index, and query documents.
- Learn to evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval algorithms.

### Scope

- Students will select a website and scrape data to create a dataset for the project.
- The topic or concept of the document retrieval system is left open for creativity.
- The system should include:
  - A scraping mechanism (to obtain the dataset).
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
  - Document indexing for efficient search.
  - A query interface to retrieve documents based on relevance (Streamlit).

### Requirements

1. **Web Scraping or Dataset Preparation**

   - Use tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or an API if available.
   - Ensure ethical scraping practices (e.g., respect robots.txt).

2. **Document Processing**

   - Clean and preprocess the text (e.g., remove noise, tokenize).

3. **Search and Retrieval System**

   - Implement an indexing mechanism (e.g., inverted index).
   - Develop a query interface using algorithms like (e.g., TF-IDF).

4. **Documentation**

   - Provide a clear README with setup and usage instructions.
