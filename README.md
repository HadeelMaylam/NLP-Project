📄 Document Retrieval System with TF-IDF and Streamlit
🧩 Overview
This project implements a Document Retrieval System using a web-scraped dataset. Users can query and retrieve relevant documents based on their search terms. The system leverages TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for document indexing and retrieval, offering a sleek and interactive interface built with Streamlit.

🎯 Project Scope
1. Data Collection


   * Extract text data using web scraping tools or APIs.
   * Follow ethical practices (e.g., respect robots.txt).


2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing


   * Remove noise such as HTML tags and special characters.
   * Tokenize, normalize, and remove stopwords.


3. TF-IDF Indexing


   * Create an inverted index for efficient retrieval.
   * Compute TF-IDF scores for ranking documents.


4. Search & Query Interface


   * Develop an algorithm for ranking documents based on query relevance.
   * Build an interactive query interface with Streamlit.


5. Evaluation


   * Measure system performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
